## Best Practices

### üîê Security
1. **Encrypt log groups** with KMS for sensitive data
2. **Use IAM policies** to restrict access to monitoring resources
3. **Implement least privilege** for service roles
4. **Monitor security events** with custom metrics
5. **Set up audit logging** for compliance requirements

### üí∞ Cost Optimization
1. **Configure appropriate retention policies** based on environment
2. **Use log filtering** to reduce storage costs
3. **Implement intelligent alerting** to reduce noise
4. **Monitor CloudWatch costs** with billing alarms
5. **Archive old logs** to S3 for long-term retention

### üìä Monitoring Strategy
1. **Start with basic monitoring** and scale up
2. **Define SLIs and SLOs** before setting up alerts
3. **Use composite alarms** for complex conditions
4. **Implement anomaly detection** for dynamic thresholds
5. **Create runbooks** for common alert scenarios

### üöÄ Performance
1. **Use appropriate metric periods** to balance cost and resolution
2. **Implement efficient log queries** for Insights
3. **Set up proper alerting thresholds** to avoid false positives
4. **Use metric filters** for real-time metrics from logs
5. **Monitor monitoring costs** regularly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**High CloudWatch Costs**
- Review log retention policies
- Check for excessive metrics generation
- Optimize log filtering and metric extraction

**Missing Metrics**
- Verify IAM permissions for metric publishing
- Check log group and stream configurations
- Validate metric filter patterns

**Alert Fatigue**
- Review alarm thresholds and evaluation periods
- Implement intelligent alerting with composite alarms
- Use anomaly detection for dynamic thresholds

## Version History

### v1.0.0
- Initial release with comprehensive monitoring features
- Enhanced alerting with multiple channels and filtering
- Anomaly detection and intelligent thresholds
- Synthetics monitoring for endpoint availability
- Auto-scaling integration with CloudWatch metrics
- Cost optimization features and retention policies
